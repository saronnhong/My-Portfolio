                <p>Fake text. Will fill in later...</p>
                <p>She woke with a gasp, not knowing who she was, or where.</p>
                <p>The smell of blood was heavy in her nostrils… or was that her nightmare, lingering? She had dreamed
                    of wolves again, of running through some dark pine forest with a great pack at her hells, hard on
                    the scent of prey.</p>
                <p>Half-light filled the room, grey and gloomy. Shivering, she sat up in bed and ran a hand across her
                    scalp. Stubble bristled against her palm. I need to shave before Izembaro sees. Mercy, I’m Mercy,
                    and tonight I’ll be raped and murdered. Her true name was Mercedene, but Mercy was all anyone ever
                    called her…</p>
                <p>Except in dreams. She took a breath to quiet the howling in her heart, trying to remember more of
                    what she’d dreamt, but most of it had gone already. There had been blood in it, though, and a full
                    moon overhead, and a tree that watched her as she ran.</p>
                <p>She had fastened the shutters back so the morning sun might wake her. But there was no sun outside
                    the window of Mercy’s little room, only a wall of shifting grey fog. The air had grown chilly… and a
                    good thing, else she might have slept all day. It would be just like Mercy to sleep through her own
                    rape.</p>
                <p>Gooseprickles covered her legs. Her coverlet had twisted around her like a snake. She unwound it,
                    threw the blanket to the bare plank floor and padded naked to the window. Braavos was lost in fog.
                    She could see the green water of the little canal below, the cobbled stone street that ran beneath
                    her building, two arches of the mossy bridge… but the far end of the bridge vanished in greyness,
                    and of the buildings across the canal only a few vague lights remained. She heard a soft splash as a
                    serpent boat emerged beneath the bridge’s central arch. “What hour?” Mercy called down to the man
                    who stood by the snake’s uplifted tail, pushing her onward with his pole.</p>
                <p>The waterman gazed up, searching for the voice. “Four, by the Titan’s roar.” His words echoed
                    hollowly off the swirling green waters and the walls of unseen buildings.</p>
                <p>She was not late, not yet, but she should not dawdle. Mercy was a happy soul and a hard worker, but
                    seldom timely. That would not serve tonight. The envoy from Westeros was expected at the Gate this
                    evening, and Izembaro would be in no mood to hear excuses, even if she served them up with a sweet
                    smile.</p>
